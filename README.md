Encryption in Python using Hand Ciphers

# How it works

I did this using a really basic method called a [Hand Cipher](https://www.ciphermachinesandcryptology.com/en/handciphers.htm).

Don't expect this to be super duper secure, it's meant to be simple.

## Here's an example of how it works:

Message: "super secret message"

Key: "my key"

### After First Keyword ("my"):

Output: sprsce esgue ertmsae

### After Second Keyword ("key"):

Output: pceuemess g taresersx

The encryption builds with each keyword so make sure your key phrase is decently long!
